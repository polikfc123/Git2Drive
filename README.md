![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

I made this program out of the need to automatically backup a Github Repository to Google Drive for a project I am currently working on. I feel like it's a niche purpose, but I hope anyone who needs it comes across this! :) Only for Windows (BAT File)
___

# INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS 
1- Generate a PAT (Personal Access Token) with necessary permissions and paste it into line 7.
2- Replace placeholders with your actual paths and preferred time interval.
3- Save changes made to the script
4- (optional) Create a shortcut to the file and move it to the startup folder to begin running backup file on startup.
5- Run the script! If you did #4, it'll begin on startup every time you login, if not, start it every time you boot and you're good! It backs up by itself, so there's no need to run it over and over again.
___

# DEPENDENCIES
You just need to have git and Google Drive for Desktop downloaded! You also need to have a copy of your repository saved.

This is my first program, so I hope you don't encounter any problems, of course. If you do, just make an issue, and I'll work on it as soon as possible!
